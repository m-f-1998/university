# University Projects

This repository is an archive of university coding projects, carried out towards the degree of MEng Software Engineering. Some of the languages used include:

- Java
- HTML; CSS; and Javascript
- PHP
- C#
- Swift
- SQL
- Python
- Alloy

I also have experience with the following languages which are not included in this repository:

- NodeJS
- React Native
- AngularJS
- C++

None of this code is guaranteed to work, as file names have been changed and a lot of the project code removed. This repository is only meant as an archive to view past projects; learning progression; and code experience.
